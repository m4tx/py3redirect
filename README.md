# py3redirect

Google search results very often have links to Python 2 docs page. However, if you are programming in Python 3, switching to version 3 docs constantly may be pretty annoying. Same thing if you're not using the latest version of Python 3 and want to always see a specific version. This extension does that for you.

## Install

The extension is available on:
* [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codfjigcljdnlklcaopdciclmmdandig/)
* [Firefox Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/py3direct/).

## Configuration

When on `docs.python.org` you can click on the extension icon to temporarily disable redirecting or to set the Python version that you'd like to redirect to. `3` will select the latest available version and the values only take one minor version (ie. `3.6`, `3.7`) since that's what's used in the URLs.
